	<h1>Reformed Family Feud Survey Results</h1>
		<p>I host a monthly game night at my church. We are a small Reformed Baptist
			congregation in Southern Ohio. Ususally, game night consists of a
			selection of my board games and a couple TVs with video game systems set
			up on them. The purpose of game night is to give our congregants a night
			each month where we can get to know each other better, all for the Glory
			of God.</p>
		<p>Twice I have run a "Bad Game Show" instead of our normal time of general
			gaming. The games in the show were heavily inspired by my favorite, now
			defunct, podcast, <a href="http://tableflipsyou.com">"Flip the table,"</a>
			particularly the "Battle of Wits" at the end of each show. The game show
			is titled "Bad Game Show" for a reason: we have members of our church
			of a wide range of theological knowledge. If the games in the show
			were based on purely knowledge of the Bible, or theological ideas,
			a certain portion of the church would blow everyone else out of the water.
