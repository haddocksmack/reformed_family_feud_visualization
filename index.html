	<h1>Reformed Family Feud Survey Results</h1>
		<p>I host a monthly game night at my church. We are a small Reformed Baptist congregation in Southern Ohio.
			Ususally, game night consists of a selection of my board games and a couple TVs with video game systems set up on them.
			The purpose of game night is to give our congregants a night each month where we can get to know each other better, all for teh Glory of God.</p>
		<p>Twice I have run a "Bad Game Show" instead of our normal time of general gaming.</p>
